It is natural and simple for us to distinguish the similarities between two different songs, but not easy for machines. This is because it is not easy to understand the context of the entire song based simply on the change in sound pressure.

The goal of this content includes the process of thinking about how to determine whether two different sound sources are in a cover relationship with each other. In the complex signal of **music** with various instruments and songs, let's have a chance to figure out what changes and doesn't change when it's covered by another artist, and think about how to extract and compare unchanged elements.

Through this content, I could understand what information can be extracted from a sound source and how to compare the information for two different sound sources.


#### Goal

- **[Final] Cross-similarity matrix analysis between two different sound sources**

- *(Goal 2) Identifying and correcting key differences between two different sound sources*
- *(Goal 3) Thinking about the definition of similarity*
- *(Goal 4) To understand the concept of Invariant*
